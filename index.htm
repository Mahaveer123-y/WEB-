<p style = "text-align:justify">This is text on my home page. I am a sentence that contains some <strong>boldface</strong> text and some <em>italic</em> text.</p>
<p style = "text-align:justify">This is a practice paragraph that contains multiple sentences. A longer paragraph like this will allow me to see <em>word wrap</em> in action in my Web browser. Word wrap means that the text will wrap to fit the width of the browser window. So long as the browser window is a reasonable width, text will not shoot off past the right edge of the window forcing me to scroll to the right to see it. The wrapping occurs at spaces between words at the ends of lines. That prevents any individual word from being split across two lines.</p>
